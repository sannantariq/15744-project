\subsection*{Risks}

We believe the key risk involved is not being able to find detailed AS topology information for our purposes. The other risks are building the test simulation may turn out to be a very time consuming task.

\subsection*{Stretch Goals}
The stretch goals are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow links offered by ASes to be dynamic
\item Move from two to arbitrarily many QoS levels offered by the Broker
\end{itemize}
