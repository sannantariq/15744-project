The milestones are as follows
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get AS topology data and define interfaces and communication protocols between the different parts of the network [50\% goal]
\item Implement a simple broker system consisting of permanently allocated slices of the network offered by ASes and two types of QoS services offered by the Broker to customers [75\% goal]
\item Simulate customer requests to the broker and report experimental results of measurements of metrics such as average network utilization, applications QoS maintained compared to standard BGP route selection [100\% goal]
\end{enumerate}
