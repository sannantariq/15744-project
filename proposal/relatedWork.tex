The past decade has seen several proposals for inter-domain routing brokers. RouteBazaar~\cite{esquivel2009routebazaar} and MiNT~\cite{valancius2008mint} suggest a free market/auction style approach to matching customers with the resources provided by customers. CXP~\cite{hong2013achieving} deal with the issue of where and how to exert control over the wide area by suggesting IXPs as nodes in the topology of an overlay network. RaaS~\cite{lakshminarayanan2004routing} most closely follows the approach we suggest, but it merely defines the higher level approach and does not delve into the process of applying this approach in the Wide Area.
