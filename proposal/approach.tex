We suggest adding a new logical entity to the Wide Area topology called the Broker. The job of the Broker is to provide a centralized interface for Content/Service Providers to acquire routes from their edge egress routers to the end customer with strict Quality of Service (QoS)  properties. There are two aspects of our approach that differ from previous work

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Broker controls the egress traffic from a Content/Service provider, allowing better utilization of resources
\item Instead of arbitrary end points, we consider the case of delivering traffic from a Content/Service provider to end customers
\end{enumerate}
